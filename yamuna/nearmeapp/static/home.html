Tiruttani is a historic temple town in Tamil Nadu, India, located in the Tiruvallur district and part of the Chennai Metropolitan Area. It is best known for the Tiruttani Murugan Temple, an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Kartikeya (Murugan), the god of war. This temple is one of the Arupadaiveedu, the six sacred abodes of Murugan.
Historically, Tiruttani was part of Andhra Pradesh until 1960, when it was transferred to Tamil Nadu based on linguistic considerations. The town is surrounded by small hills and has a hot and humid climate. It is well-connected to major cities like Chennai (80 km away), Tirupati (66 km), and Vellore (80 km)
