The Tiruttani Murugan Temple, also known as Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple, is one of the six sacred abodes (Arupadaiveedu) of Lord Murugan, located in Tiruttani, Tamil Nadu. Perched atop a hill with 365 steps, symbolizing the days of the year, this temple is believed to be the place where Lord Murugan calmed his anger after defeating the demon Tarakasura, which is why the Surasamharam festival is not celebrated here. The templeâ€™s Dravidian-style architecture features intricate carvings and a grand gopuram, and its main deity, Murugan, is worshipped alongside his consorts Valli and Devasena. The temple has strong connections to Indra, the king of gods, who is said to have gifted his daughter Devasena to Murugan along with his divine elephant Airavata. It is open daily from 5:45 AM to 9:00 PM, with significant rituals such as Viswaroopa Pooja (5:45 AM), Kalasandhi Pooja (8:00 AM), Uchikkala Pooja (12:00 PM), Sayaraksha Pooja (5:00 PM), and Palliyarai Pooja (8:45 PM). Special sevas, including the Golden Chariot procession, Panchamritha Abhishekam, and Thirukalyana Urchavam, attract devotees throughout the year.
