    Kailasakona Waterfalls is a serene and picturesque perennial waterfall located in the Nagari Valley, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, near Tiruttani. Cascading from a height of approximately 30 meters, the waterfall forms a clear pond below, and its waters are believed to have medicinal properties. Surrounded by lush greenery, it offers a tranquil retreat for nature lovers. Close to the falls, there is a small temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and Parvati, adding a spiritual touch to the location. According to legend, Lord Kailasanatheswara Swamy visited this site during the wedding of Lord Venkateswara Swamy and Goddess Padmavathi at Narayanavanam, which is about 9 km away. The best time to visit is between October and February, when the water flow is at its peak. The falls are easily accessible by road, and visitors can reach the foot of the falls with their vehicles. APSRTC buses connect Tirupati and Puttur to the site, and nearby guest houses, such as Haritha Hotel, provide accommodation options
